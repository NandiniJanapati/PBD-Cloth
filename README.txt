This was the fifth assignment I did for Computer Animation at Texas A&M
The goal was to simulate a cloth colliding with a sphere using PBD.

Run simulation with spacebar
step one frame forward - 'h'
reset - 'r'
Rotate - click and drag
Zoom - ctrl + click and drag
Pan - shift + click and drag
